# Blockchain-Based Educational Transcript Verification

## Overview

This project implements a blockchain solution for verifying educational transcripts and credentials. By leveraging smart contracts on a blockchain network, the system provides secure, tamper-proof, and transparent verification of academic achievements.

## Key Components

### Institution Verification Contract
- Validates and registers legitimate educational institutions
- Maintains a trusted registry of accredited educational entities
- Allows authorized updates to institutional information
- Prevents fraudulent institutions from issuing credentials

### Student Identity Contract
- Securely manages learner identity information
- Implements privacy controls to protect personal data
- Links verified student identities to their academic records
- Supports self-sovereign identity principles

### Course Completion Contract
- Records individual academic achievements
- Stores course details, grades, and completion status
- Links achievements to verified institution and student identities
- Implements cryptographic proof of achievement integrity

### Transcript Access Contract
- Controls permissions for viewing credential information
- Allows students to grant temporary or permanent access to third parties
- Maintains audit logs of credential access
- Provides verification interfaces for employers and other educational institutions

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14.0+)
- Truffle Suite
- MetaMask or similar Web3 wallet
- Ganache (for local development)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blockchain-transcript-verification.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd blockchain-transcript-verification

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile smart contracts
truffle compile

# Deploy to local blockchain
truffle migrate
```

## Usage

The system provides interfaces for different stakeholders:

### For Educational Institutions
- Register and validate institutional identity
- Issue course completion certificates and degrees
- Manage authorized representatives

### For Students
- Create and manage educational identity
- View personal academic achievements
- Control access to transcript information

### For Verifiers (Employers, Other Institutions)
- Request access to student transcripts
- Verify authenticity of academic credentials
- Validate institutional accreditation

## Security Considerations

- Private keys must be securely managed by all participants
- Student data is encrypted and access-controlled
- Smart contract auditing is recommended before production deployment
